# Article Content Management System

This repository contains a structured approach to managing article content across multiple platforms.

## Structure

```
Directory/
└── Article/
    ├── Linkedin/
    ├── Medium/
    └── Reddit/
```

Each platform contains daily folders (one month from 2025-08-15) with:
- `images/` - Visual content for posts
- `article/` - Written content and drafts

## Usage

1. Navigate to the appropriate platform and date folder
2. Add your images to the `images/` folder
3. Edit the `draft.md` file in the `article/` folder
4. Use the README files in each folder for guidance

## Platforms

- **LinkedIn**: Professional networking content
- **Medium**: Long-form articles and insights
- **Reddit**: Community-focused discussions
